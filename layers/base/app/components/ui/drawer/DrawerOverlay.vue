  <!--
    Classes copied from coss `apps/ui/registry/default/ui/drawer.tsx`
    (DrawerBackdrop), with the two swipe variables renamed.

    coss reads `--drawer-swipe-progress` and `--drawer-swipe-strength` here, and
    in React that works because the backdrop's inline style object is a constant
    the renderer never re-applies. reka's port rebuilds that object on every
    render and lists it as a dynamic prop (`DrawerOverlayImpl.js:36-52`), so Vue
    writes `--drawer-swipe-progress: 0` back over ours on every re-render, and
    which value survives comes down to component id ordering in the scheduler.
    Reading variables only `DrawerContent` writes takes the race away entirely —
    reka is free to keep resetting its own copy, nothing here looks at it.

    `motion-reduce:transition-none!` matches what Sheet already does in
    `transitions.css`. With no transition running, `useTransitionStatus` finds
    nothing in `getAnimations()` and unmounts straight away, which is the
    behaviour someone asking for reduced motion is asking for.
